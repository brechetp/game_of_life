#  .NOSYN: g h # g.vhd and h.vhd are not for synthesis
#  a: b        # Intra module dependency: a.vhd depends on b.vhd. For simulation, b.vhd must be compiled before a.vhd. For synthesis b.vhd must be loaded before a.vhd.
#  c: d_lib.e  # Inter-module dependency: c.vhd depends on ../d/e.vhd.
#
#  By convention a VHDL source file named foo.vhd contains entity foo and its architecture(s); file foo_pkg.vhd contains package foo and its package body if any.
#  Configurations and component instantiations are not used. Hierarchical design is based on entity instantiation. Compilation, simulation and synthesis scripts
#  rely on the local src/<m>/'dependencies.txt' and src/<m>/'Makefile' files. They MUST absolutely be maintained up to date.
